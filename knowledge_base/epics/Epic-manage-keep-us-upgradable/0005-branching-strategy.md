### Epic: Manage & Keep Us Upgradable — Branching Strategy

**Epic ID**: `Epic-manage-keep-us-upgradable`
**Created**: 2026-02-18
**Goal**: Make it easy to (1) stay current with upstream, (2) keep our fork stable, and (3) create clean, atomic PRs back to upstream.

This document is intentionally procedural. If you follow it, you should be able to:
1. Create/refresh a clean “upstream-based” branch line in our fork
2. Generate one PR branch per fix/feature (PRD) with minimal, reviewable diffs
3. Avoid long-lived conflict accumulation

### 1) Glossary / mental model

- **`upstream`**: the canonical `aider-desk` repository we want to contribute to.
- **`origin`**: our fork (where we push branches).
- **`main` (our fork)**: should remain stable, deployable, and can contain “business-critical” divergence.
- **`upstream/main`**: the base branch for upstream PRs.
- **`sync/*` branches**: “integration snapshots” created in our fork that track upstream closely and are used to validate and stage updates.
- **PR branches**: short-lived branches created off `upstream/main` (preferred) or off a `sync/*` snapshot, containing exactly one upstream-appropriate change.

---

### 2) Required git remotes (one-time setup)

From the repo root:

```bash
# Verify what you have
git remote -v

# Ensure `origin` points to *our fork*
# (If you cloned our fork, this is typically already correct.)

# Add upstream remote (canonical aider-desk repo)
git remote add upstream <UPSTREAM_GIT_URL>

# Fetch both
git fetch origin
git fetch upstream
```

Notes:
- Replace `<UPSTREAM_GIT_URL>` with the upstream repository URL (SSH or HTTPS).
- We **never push** to `upstream` directly; we push to `origin` and open PRs to upstream.

---

### 3) Standard branch names (conventions)

#### Long-lived

- `main` (on `origin`): our fork’s stable branch.

#### Integration snapshots (in our fork)

- `sync/upstream-YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Example: `sync/upstream-2026-02-17`
  - Meaning: “A snapshot branch that merges or fast-forwards to upstream/main at that date, validated locally.”

#### Upstream PR branches (in our fork)

Use atomic, intention-revealing names:

- `fix/<topic>`
- `feat/<topic>`
- `perf/<topic>`
- `test/<topic>`

Examples aligned to our current PR candidates:

- `fix/agent-profile-lookup-fallback`
- `fix/profile-aware-task-init`
- `feat/task-tooling-clarity`
- `fix/ollama-aider-prefix`
- `perf/token-count-debouncing`
- `fix/ipc-max-listeners`
- `test/jsdom-storage-mocks`

---

### 4) Creating (or refreshing) an upstream tracking branch

This creates a local branch you can always reset to match upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -B upstream-main upstream/main
```

This `upstream-main` branch is local convenience only (do not PR from it).

---

### 5) Creating a `sync/upstream-YYYY-MM-DD` snapshot branch

Use this when you want a validated baseline in our fork that represents upstream at a point in time.

```bash
# Start from upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout -B sync/upstream-YYYY-MM-DD upstream/main

# Push the snapshot branch to our fork
git push -u origin sync/upstream-YYYY-MM-DD
```

Verification (recommended for a snapshot you intend to build on):

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint:check
npm run typecheck
npm run test
```

If these checks fail on pure upstream, record that in the epic notes before continuing.

---

### 6) How to create clean upstream PR branches (the core workflow)

#### Rule 1: PR branches should be based on `upstream/main` unless there’s a reason not to

Preferred:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b fix/<topic> upstream/main
```

Alternative (if you want to base on a validated snapshot):

```bash
git checkout -b fix/<topic> origin/sync/upstream-YYYY-MM-DD
```

#### Rule 2: One PR branch = one PRD / one upstream-worthy change

This aligns with `knowledge_base/AIDER_DESK_PR_STRATEGY.md` (atomic PRs).

#### Rule 3: Prefer PRD-driven reimplementation over “dragging fork history”

You have two ways to build the PR branch:

1) **Reimplement from PRD** (preferred for long-term upgradability)
   - Use the PRD’s reproduction steps + acceptance criteria
   - Implement the minimal fix
   - Add/update tests if appropriate

2) **Cherry-pick from our fork** (allowed when it is clean and obviously correct)
   - Useful for small, self-contained changes
   - Still ensure the resulting PR diff is small and reviewable

Cherry-pick example:

```bash
# Identify the commit(s) on our fork branch containing the change
git log origin/main --oneline

# On your PR branch based on upstream/main:
git cherry-pick <commit_sha>
```

Guardrails for cherry-picking:
- Avoid cherry-picking merge commits.
- If cherry-picking pulls unrelated formatting/dependency churn, stop and reimplement instead.

---

### 7) Keeping PRs clean (practical checks)

Before pushing:

```bash
# Inspect exactly what upstream will see
git diff --stat upstream/main...HEAD
git diff upstream/main...HEAD

# Confirm you didn’t accidentally include lockfile churn
git status
```

If `package-lock.json` changes but your PR does not require dependency changes, fix it before pushing.

---

### 8) Pushing PR branches and opening upstream PRs

```bash
git push -u origin fix/<topic>
```

Then open a PR:
- **Base repo**: upstream `aider-desk`
- **Base branch**: `main`
- **Head repo**: our fork
- **Compare branch**: `fix/<topic>` (or `feat/*`, etc.)

PR description should include:
- Problem statement + reproduction (from PRD)
- Summary of change
- Test evidence (commands run + results)

---

### 9) Recommended sequence for this epic

Use `knowledge_base/AIDER_DESK_PR_STRATEGY.md` as the canonical grouping. Recommended order:

1. **Testing infrastructure**: `test/jsdom-storage-mocks`
2. **Agent orchestration fixes**: `fix/agent-orchestration-*` (split if needed)
3. **Ollama Aider integration**: `fix/ollama-aider-prefix`
4. **Platform performance/stability**: `perf/token-count-debouncing`, `fix/ipc-max-listeners`

Rationale:
- Better tests reduce risk for subsequent PRs.
- Orchestration fixes are higher impact and likely to be accepted.
- Performance/stability improvements are easier to review after functional correctness is solid.

---

### 10) What happens to our fork `main`?

We keep `origin/main` stable and deployable.

When upstream releases move forward:
1. Create a new `sync/upstream-YYYY-MM-DD` snapshot and validate it
2. Re-evaluate each PRD against upstream (per `0000-epic-overview.md`)
3. Reapply only what is still needed (prefer PRD-driven reimplementation)
4. Decide what remains fork-only vs what becomes upstream PRs
