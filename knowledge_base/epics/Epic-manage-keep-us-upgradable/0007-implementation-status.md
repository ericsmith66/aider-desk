### Epic: Manage & Keep Us Upgradable — Implementation Status (Execution Log)

**Epic ID**: `Epic-manage-keep-us-upgradable`
**Created**: 2026-02-18
**Purpose**: Track execution of the epic **as we actually perform it**, one PRD at a time, and record what changed **branch → branch**.

---

## 🚨 Non-Optional

This document is part of the workflow. **Following the process and updating this log is not optional.**

If we skip tracking, we lose the ability to answer:
- “What is on `sync/*` right now?”
- “Which PRD branches exist and what do they contain?”
- “What did we merge into `main`, and why?”

Policy sources:
- `knowledge_base/epics/Epic-manage-keep-us-upgradable/0000-epic-overview.md`
- `knowledge_base/epics/Epic-manage-keep-us-upgradable/0005-branching-strategy.md`
- `knowledge_base/epics/Epic-manage-keep-us-upgradable/0006-atomic-execution-plan.md`

## How to use this document

### What to update (minimum)

For each PRD you execute:
1. Add/refresh its row in **PRD execution status**
2. Add a short entry in **Branch-to-branch change log**
3. Record upstream links (Issue/PR) once created

### What not to do

- Do **not** paste full diffs.
- Do **not** include `knowledge_base/**` changes in upstream PR branches.
- Do **not** treat this as optional “nice documentation” — it’s the coordination artifact.
